An emacs theme that ports the very nice VSCode theme "Material Themes - Ocean High Contrast". 

See the original pallette [here](https://github.com/material-theme/vsc-material-theme/blob/a0079e8d0cc8711cd81d410827fcc16bcb1f9e6b/scripts/generator/settings/specific/ocean-hc.ts)

It's made with autothemer.

TODO:

- [ ] Add support for more font-locking modes
- [ ] Confirm color matching on different languages
- - [ ] Python
- - [ ] C/C++
- - [ ] Rust
- - [ ] Javascript
- [ ] Port the non-high-contrast version

Note: This is still very much a work in progress. When it's mostly good for release I'll throw some screenshots up.
