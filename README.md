An emacs theme loosely based on my favorite VSCode theme "Community Material Themes -- Ocean High Contrast". It uses some of the same colors on a deep blue background. I've modified things so that they are more to my liking.

It's made in an afternoon with autothemer.

The name is a reference to "Tungsten Arm" O'Doyle of the 1921 Akron Groomsmen baseball team.

Note: This is still very much a work in progress. When it's mostly good for release I'll throw some screenshots up.
