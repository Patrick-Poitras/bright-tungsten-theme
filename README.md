An emacs theme loosely based on my favorite VSCode theme "Material Themes - Ocean High Contrast". It uses some of the same colors on a deep blue background. I've modified things so that they are more to my liking. (Mostly emphasis on Navy Blue/Gold for eshell) See the original pallette [here](https://github.com/material-theme/vsc-material-theme/blob/a0079e8d0cc8711cd81d410827fcc16bcb1f9e6b/scripts/generator/settings/specific/ocean-hc.ts)

It's made in an afternoon with autothemer.

The name is a reference to "Tungsten Arm" O'Doyle of the 1921 Akron Groomsmen baseball team.

Note: This is still very much a work in progress. When it's mostly good for release I'll throw some screenshots up.
